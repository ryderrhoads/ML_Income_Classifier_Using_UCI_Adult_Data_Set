# ML Income Classifier Using UCI Adult Data Set  

## Project Overview  

This project applies machine learning algorithms to the UCI Adult Income dataset to predict whether an individual's income exceeds $50,000 annually. The analysis includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and implementation of Lasso, Ridge regression, and Random Forest models.  

The project was completed as part of the **ECON 418-518: Introduction to Econometrics** course at the University of Arizona.

## Key Results  

- **Lasso Regression**: Best classification accuracy = `81.31%` with λ = `0.0518`.  
- **Ridge Regression**: Best classification accuracy = `81.12%` with λ = `0.0373`.  
- **Random Forest**: Best testing accuracy = `80.36%` with 300 trees.  

**Conclusion**: Lasso regression had the highest classification accuracy among the models tested.
